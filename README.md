## Usage

1. **Data Preprocessing**: Preprocess the dataset to prepare it for training the model.
2. **Model Training**: Train the sentiment analysis model using the preprocessed dataset.
3. **Model Evaluation**: Evaluate the performance of the trained model on a separate test dataset.
4. **Inference**: Use the trained model to predict the sentiment of new movie reviews.

## Model Architecture

The sentiment analysis model is built using TensorFlow and Keras. It consists of an embedding layer, LSTM layers, and fully connected layers.
